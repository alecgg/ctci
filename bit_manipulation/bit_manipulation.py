# 5.1 Insertion: You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and
# j.  Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.  You
# can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.  That is, if
# M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.  You would not, for
# example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.


def insert(n: int, m: int, i: int, j: int) -> int:
    length = 32
    # n     m   i   j
    # 11111 00  1   3 ->  10001?

    # Clear space in n for m of size j - i + 1 at positions [i, j] (part the sea)
    # 1---1
    # shift m over by i positions
    # --00-
    # insert m into n
    # 1-001
    pass


# 5.2 Binary to String: Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print
# the binary representation.  If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32
# characters, print "ERROR."
def binary_to_string(number):
    pass


# 5.3 Flip Bit to Win: You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1.  Write code to
# find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.
def longest_one_run(integer):
    pass


# 5.4 Next Number: Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that
# have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
def next_number(integer):
    pass

# 5.5 Debugger: Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n - 1)) == 0)


# 5.6 Conversion: Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert
# integer A to integer B.

# 5.7 Pairwise swap.  Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as
# possible.  (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).

# 5.8 Draw Line: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
# pixels to be stored in one byte.  THe screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will
# be split across rows).  The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array
# and the width.  Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
# The method signature should look something like this:
# drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)
